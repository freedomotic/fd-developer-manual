Set your local development environment
--------------------------------------

1) Fork Freedomotic on GitHub

* Create an account on https://github.com if you don't already have one
* Fork the Freedomotic repository by following this link: https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic/fork
* Create the local clone of your online fork with this command:

.. code::
     
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/freedomotic.git
   
Now you are ready to work.

2) Enter the new local folder

.. code::

    cd freedomotic
    
3) Compile Freedomotic with maven

.. code::

    mvn clean install
    
4) **IMPORTANT!!!! THIS IS REQUIRED: copy the example-data folder into freedomotic-core/data.**

If you miss this step Freedomotic won't start

.. code::

    cp -r data-example/ framework/freedomotic-core/data
    
5) Run Freedomotic

.. code::

    java -jar framework/freedomotic-core/target/freedomotic-core/freedomotic.jar

    
Git repository is an SDK
------------------------

The Git repository is a complete SDK with all you need to code and test your Freedomotic plugins. Once compiled for the first time, open the **freedomotic-core** project with your favourite IDE and start it to try Freedomotic.

To develop your own plugin, you can start from the **hello-world** example project included in *GIT_ROOT/plugins/devices/hello-world*. 

Open it in your IDE, make some changes and compile. It will be automatically installed into the Freedomotic runtime (**freedomotic-core** project). Just start **freedomotic-core** to try your latest changes.
