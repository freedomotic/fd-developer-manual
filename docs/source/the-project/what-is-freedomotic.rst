What is Freedomotic?
====================

Freedomotic is an open source, flexible and secure Internet of Things (IoT) development framework. It can be used to build and manage modern smart spaces. It is targeted at individuals (home automation) as well as businesses (smart retail environments, ambient aware marketing, monitoring and analytics, etc).
Freedomotic can interact with well-known automation protocols as well as with "do it yourself" solutions. It treats the web, social networks and branded frontends as first class components of the system.

It allows you to build smart spaces. Freedomotic can manage many spaces, ranging from from small apartments to huge buildings, like museums, schools, corporate offices, malls and university campuses. For OEMs and software developers, Freedomotic is the solution to create building automation systems, smart retail environments, home automation managed services and innovative IoT ambient aware applications, drastically reducing development effort and time to market.
 
Freedomotic can be integrated with popular building automation technologies like BTicino OpenWebNet, Modbus RTU, Z-wave as well as custom automation projects using Arduino devices, do it yourself boards, third party graphical frontends, text to speech engines, motion detection using IP cameras stream, social networks, and much more... All this features can be delivered from a marketplace as downloadable plugins.

Vision
######
Bridging the gap between the physical and digital world; connecting people to things and value-added business services.

Mission
#######
Developing an application framework, which reduces the effort and time to maket required to produce solutions based on the Internet of Things concept. This means we are making the environment aware of the people and the thinngs in it. Things can reach a new level of usefulness thanks to their new connected nature, allowing them to leverage the web and all of the information based services it provides.

Current development stage
#########################
The project is currently in an advanced beta stage. We are using the home automation segment to test and attract users but its range of application is much wider. 

The final purpose of the project is to build a sort of **Content Management System (CMS)** for building automation.
It will abstract and make easily available the common features required by building automation system in a way privates and companies can extend it to create custom context aware/environment aware services.
