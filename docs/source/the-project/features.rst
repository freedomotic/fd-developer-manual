Features
========


**Identity**: Freedomotic allows each Thing to have a persistent unique identifier, which allows you to address it from all over the world, and it works no matter which automation protocol drives the Thing. You are safe from the protocols hell out there.

**Services**: Freedomotic is different, automations are not the end of the story, this framework is centred around the concept of Services for users, which may use automations to achive a goal. It is the Internet of Things at a new level. ThinG Wider!

**Simulation**: Freedomotic allows you to fully run it without any sensors or actuators connected. You can configure and test your automations before buying the hardware. This is great when planning a system with your customers, giving them a taste of the finished product.

**Realtime Marketing**: Freedomotic knows the environment topology (ie: rooms shapes and locations), the People and Things in it. This allows for users in the environment to be tracked and profiled, in addition to creating 1 to 1 realtime marketing campaigns. This feature is also great for disabled assistance and security focused systems.

**Crosslanguage Rest API**:  Freedomotic allows you to control any aspect of the system with our JSON based REST APIs, from listing and controlling the Things in an environment, to retrieving, installing and managing plugins, all using familiar and developer-friendly technologies. The entire system is completely Events based. Components dialog together using text Events and Commands, so it's easy to integrate your ERP, CRM, or any legacy software you already run on your own premises. This is also great for building custom-branded frontends for web, mobile and desktop. In Freedomotic you can concurrently run as many frontends as you want, with the ability to have each one targeted to a specific audience.

**Distributed**: Freedomotic can run as a decentralized peer to peer network with no single point of failure, and can be deployed on a network of embedded systems like Raspberry Pi or on standard PCs and servers. For business this means you can have an instance running in the cloud connected to different satellites. You can manage the configuration and provide unique compute intensive features in the cloud (eg: face recognition) for a monthly fee.

**Plugins**: The system features are not hardcoded, and you can install new plugins at runtime. If you are interested in plugins development, take a look at our Developers Getting Started tutorial. Any developed plugin can be uploaded to an online marketplace (ours or your own) to allow 1-click installation.

**Autodiscovery**: Wouldn't it be great if you could turn on a light and have it automatically configured on the virtual environment map? Freedomotic can autodiscover the Things (eg: home automation devices) deployed in your real environment. No more diving in complex configuration files.

**History Aware**: Freedomotic can track any status changes in the environment and persist them in a database for analysis. For example,  you can analyze consumption behaviors to implement energy-saving strategies, or you can learn more about how your customers interact with your shop by monitoring their visit patterns.

**Secure, Multilanguage and Multiuser**: Freedomotic is built ground up with multilanguage, multiuser and security features in mind. All these features come for free for each new plugin you develop, sparing a lot of time and effort. You can focus on your core business and let Freedomotic do the heavy lifting.
