##Introduction##
One of the main features of Freedomotic is its plugin-based architecture. A plugin allow to integrate any hardware, object or device in Freedomotic just with a simple configuration.

Thanks to the Freedomotic modular feature, anyone could create his own "Marketplace" (http://freedomotic.com/plugins) or plugin package provider, from where the integrator could download and install the plugins packages easily. Also, any provider could be combined with the others, so the user doesn't need to search in several different places.

A MarketPlace Provider, could be a web page, an ftp, a local directory, any place in which a package with the Freedomotic format could be stored and be accessible.

##Details##
Freedomotic comes with an already deployed provider that acces to the MarketPlace? in the main page of Freedomotic:

http://www.freedomotic.com/plugins

###Steps to create a provider using Netbeans:###
1. Create a new class project for our provider.
2. Include the library org-openide-util-lookup.jar
This library is already included with the Netbeans installation and could be found in the path: NETBEANSDIR/platform/lib/org-openide-util-lookup.jar. However, it is also include in the trunk/lib/core directory of the freedomotic repository.
3. Create a new basic class in java. This class must extends IMarketPlace, alse we must use the Java decorators so Netbeans could create the correct files in META-INF when the project is build.
```java
    import org.openide.util.lookup.ServiceProvider;
    import com.freedomotic.service.IMarketPlace;
    import com.freedomotic.service.PluginPackage;
    import java.util.ArrayList;

    @ServiceProvider(service = IMarketPlace.class)
    public class FreedomoticMarketPlace implements IMarketPlace{

    public FreedomoticMarketPlace() {
       
    }

    @Override
    public ArrayList<PluginPackage> getAvailablePackages() {
       //TO BE developed
    }

    @Override
    public void updatePackageList() {
       //TO BE developed
    }

}
```
The last thing to do is to fill the methods that retrieve the plugin information.

##Provider Deployment##
To install the provider in Freedomotic is as easy as just build and copy the .jar file and libraries to the directory /plugins/providers/ (the libraries must be copied to /plugins/providers/lib) The next time Freedomotic starts, the provider will be available.
