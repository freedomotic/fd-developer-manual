Reactions are based on the concept of [Channel](https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic/wiki/The-Channels-Concept), so be sure to have understood this concept before continue reading.

# Introduction
A reaction consists of a trigger and one or more commands. The commands in a list are executed sequentially. The reactions run in parallel within a dedicated thread for each of them. The triggers and the commands are defined in files independent from the same reaction, which represents only a link. So it is possible to reuse commands and triggers in different reactions.

Example:

*  Reaction Name: entertainment scenario
*  Trigger: TV turns ON
*  Command Sequence 1: Turn OFF Livingroom lights
*  Command Sequence 2: Close Windows -> Close Blinds

When is monday evening and the TV turns ON the lights in the livingroom are switched off. At the same time the windows start to close, when all the windows are completely closed the system begins the lowering the blinds.

XML Representation
Reaction are deployed on _**FREEDOMOTIC_ROOT/data/rea**_ folder. This is the XML describing the previous scenary.
```xml
<reaction>
  <trigger>TV turns ON</trigger>
  <sequences>
    <sequence>
      <command>Turn OFF Livingroom lights</command>
    </sequence>
    <sequence>
      <command>Close Livingroom windows</command>
      <command>Close Livingroom blinds</command>
    </sequence>
  </sequences>
</reaction>
```

## Composing triggers in automations (extra-conditions)##
This means is possible to create automations like IF [it's morning] AND [livingroom light is on] THEN [do something]

The "**extra conditions**" feature is represented by "AND [livingroom light is on]" which allows you to lookup for the current value of any object on the map to create additional conditions which are evaluated before your automation is executed. There is still no frontend support for this feature, you should define it in XML editing the XML file in the _**data/rea**_ folder (is the folder which contains the **automations**, AKA **reactions**).

Here an example "WHEN a door is clicked AND livingroom light is on OR kitchen light is on THEN switch the open state of the clicked door":

```xml
    <reaction>
      <trigger>When a door is clicked</trigger>
      <conditions>
        <condition>
            <target>Livingroom Light</target>
            <statement>
                <logical>AND</logical>
                <attribute>powered</attribute>
                <operand>EQUALS</operand>
                <value>true</value>
            </statement>
        </condition>
        <condition>
            <target>Kitchen Light</target>
            <statement>
                <logical>OR</logical>
                <attribute>powered</attribute>
                <operand>EQUALS</operand>
                <value>true</value>
            </statement>
        </condition>
      </conditions>
      <sequence>
        <command>Switch its open state</command>
        <command>test</command>
      </sequence>
    </reaction>
```
